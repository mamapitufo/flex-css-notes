. StyleManager#setStyleDeclaration(): how does it work? Is this called by the
  generated code?

. note about how the idea in Flex4, sort of, is to move away from styles.

. how do inheritable styles work? are they only applied to children of
  *containers*?
    - "global" selector applies style rules to *all* components, even when the
      rules are not inheritable.
    - type selectors are inherited in the class definition hierarchy, always.

. if there are many class selectors in styleName, they are applied in the
  order they have in styleName, not at declaration time. really?

. how do descendant selectors work? how is the matching done?

. modules, factory, defaultFactory: how do they work? difference between
-compiler.defaults-css-files and including an external stylesheet via
<fx:Style source="foo"/>

. what happens when a component is parented? --alternatives--
  when styleName is changed?
